I’ve belatedly taken up a skincare routine, after much badgering from friends and loved ones. I found skincare overwhelming, but it turns out a “bare minimum” routine is not so complicated. So for future reference, and to comfort anyone also intimidated by skincare, here’s my daily routine:

- Morning (right after getting up)
  - Rinse
  - Moisturizer
  - Sunscreen
- Evening (right before going to bed)
  - Rinse
  - Cleanser
  - Moisturizer

The sunscreen is by far the most important part; if you don’t have any kind of skincare routine, at least apply some sunscreen. Also, I’ve been warned only to apply cleanser in the evening, because otherwise my skin will dry out too fast.

I use La Roche-Posay’s cleanser and moisturizer because I like their sunscreen and Amazon had a three-for-one deal one time. There’s a whole world of different skin types, but I’m going for the bare minimum here, so I just picked a moisturizer that works for normal or oily skin and assumed I have one of those.

Yes, I know American La Roche-Posay is the not the same as European La Roche-Posay, because the FDA hasn’t approved any new ingredients since the 90s. It still feels nicer than the average American sunscreen.

I don’t think I actually look any different, but it is nice to have smooth, moisturized skin instead of an oily mess. I don’t quite agree with all the friends that urgently demanded I adopt a skincare routine, but given it barely takes a minute a day, I can recommend adopting a bare-minimum routine.
