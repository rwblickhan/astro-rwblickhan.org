# Matcha Lattes

Lately I’ve been making a lot of matcha lattes. Here’s the recipe I’ve settled on.

- I heat 8oz (1 cup) of water to 180°F in my beloved [OXO adjustable-temperature kettle](https://www.oxo.com/adjustable-temperature-kettle.html). Some snobs prefer to use distilled water, but I’m not precious about water quality; San Francisco’s tap water is soft enough for my palate.
- I measure out the matcha powder into a bowl. The [matcha I use](https://ashateahouse.com/collections/matcha/products/matcha-select) suggests 5g (or 1tsp) for 8oz water; since I add 4oz of milk, I typically go with a rounded teaspoon of matcha. I used to measure out exactly 7.5g matcha on a kitchen scale, but the taste wasn’t noticeably different.
- I whisk the matcha for twenty seconds with a bamboo [*chasen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_utensils#Whisks). The best technique is to whisk back-and-forth in a W shape instead of a circle. You really do need to use a *chasen* — I’ve tried using a standard whisk or a fork or even a milk frother, and none of them can break up the clumps of matcha enough. I found mine at a Japanese grocery store, but most tea shops sell them as well. You should store the *chasen* on the countertop, either upside down or on a [whisk stand](https://ashateahouse.com/collections/tea-ware/products/whisk-stand), to maintain its shape. Also, you should replace it every year, since bacteria will accumulate in the tips even with regular cleanings.
- After pouring the whisked matcha into a cup, I add 1/2oz of 2:1 simple syrup (so 2 tsp sugar). I always keep a 12oz [squeeze bottle](https://www.oxo.com/chef-s-squeeze-bottles-6-ounces-1999.html) of simple syrup in the fridge and measure it out with a [cocktail jigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_glass#Jigger). I usually keep flavored simple syrups as well, so I can add a mint or ginger flavor to the matcha.
- While preparing everything above, I heat 4oz (1/2 cup) of milk in a saucier on the stovetop. Just as it starts to steam, I froth it for about 5 seconds with a [handheld milk frother](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/small-things/#milk-frother). Then I pour the frothed milk over the matcha.
