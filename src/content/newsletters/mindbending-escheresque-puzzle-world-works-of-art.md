*Yes, it‚Äôs me, Russell, back with another exciting issue of ‚Äúwhat have you done in the past two weeks‚Äù, which (it will surprise nobody) mostly consists of online board games. If you don‚Äôt remember who I am or why you‚Äôre here (which, to be honest, I don‚Äôt know either most of the time), please do feel free to click the big unsubscribe button at the bottom. Or, stay here, and we‚Äôll see what merry adventures we end up on!*

*By the way, I‚Äôd love to have a recurring mailbag segment, but that would require I actually get mail. So, if you have any thoughts, feelings, or questions about this issue, fire away and (with your permission, of course), maybe I‚Äôll include it in a future issue.*

I hope quarantine is treating you all well. Or, at least, not badly. It‚Äôs been another two weeks (has it really?) and the world keeps spinning, more or less.

Also, in [Robin Sloan‚Äôs last newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com), he mentioned how he‚Äôs been using open access museum collections to find pictures for his newsletter. Which is a great idea! Museums have some great-looking stuff! So, from now on, there will be a mix of my own pictures (which you‚Äôre hopefully used to by now) and works from museum archives.

### What I‚Äôm Working On

Oh, you know, the usual. Website revamp is coming along, piano is occasionally played, Buttonup now has tabs:

Tabs that don‚Äôt do anything, but‚Ä¶

### What I‚Äôm Reading

Every week I‚Äôve been looking forward to new posts from [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog), which is, as the subtitle says, ‚Äúa look at the history of battle in popular culture‚Äù. If you‚Äôre the kind to browse [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/), you will probably love Bret Devereaux‚Äôs work as well. Recently, he talked about [why we don‚Äôt use chemical weapons anymore](https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/). Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not because the world is suddenly goody-two-shoes. Rather, he delves into the difference between what he refers to as ‚Äúmodern‚Äù militaries (the armies of the US, Europe, China, and so on, descended from World War I and II) and ‚Äústatic‚Äù militaries, and the role of chemical weapons in each. It calls to mind the recent [War on the Rocks podcast episode ‚ÄúWho Needs Landmines?‚Äù](https://warontherocks.com/2020/02/who-needs-landmines/), in which the guests argue about whether landmines are necessary and why they are still used. I do think (applying *The Secret of Our Success* and *Giving Up the Gun*) that he undersells the influence of culture; after all, most weapons are horrible, but chemical weapons do seem to have an especially reviled place in our culture, associated very strongly with the horrors of the Great War, and while major powers might consider chemical (and biological!) weapons if they were effective, I suspect they would seriously think twice about it. Still, this is an _extremely_ good article, and I also highly recommend all his other article series, like [‚ÄúPractical Polytheism‚Äù](https://acoup.blog/2019/10/25/collections-practical-polytheism-part-i-knowledge/) (on how polytheism in the Ancient Greek and Roman world was _actually_ practiced) and [‚ÄúThe Lonely City‚Äù](https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/) (which is, roughly, about the urban design of premodern cities).
 
Rolling Stone had a feature on [‚ÄúThe Unsolved Case of the Most Mysterious Song on the Internet‚Äù](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/most-mysterious-song-on-the-internet-885106/). It‚Äôs a rather interesting story (similar to [Reply All‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Case of the Missing Hit‚Äù](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2h8bx/158-the-case-of-the-missing-hit)) although, spoiler alert, it _is_ unsolved. Two thoughts: hey, this song is pretty good! As you may know, I‚Äôm a connoisseur of music released between 1978 and 1984, so this is, in fact, right up my alley. Secondly, it‚Äôs fascinating to think about just how much stuff is just‚Ä¶ lost. Like, what if somebody discovers this newsletter in thirty years‚Äîwill I still be around? Will I be able to answer questions about it? Will I even remember it? It‚Äôs honestly surprising more _isn‚Äôt_ lost.

Also, Sherry started a newsletter, [Flash Fiction from Frostyshadows](https://buttondown.email/frostyshadows). I highly recommend subscribing üòâ

### What I‚Äôm Watching

I watched *The Seventh Seal*, Ingmar Bergman‚Äôs classic knight-playing-chess-with-death treatise on our mortality. It is, in fact, a classic! I mean, it was obviously made in the late ‚Äò50s, and some parts (the editing, occasionally) do feel somewhat of another time‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs really something special, despite that. The impression I got (spoilers follow; just watch it) was that death was in fact merely a metaphor, not a literal character, and that the whole chess distraction was not to be taken literally either; as death says, ‚ÄúNothing escapes me. No one escapes me.‚Äù That is, Block‚Äôs ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù was more a comfort to him, and not literally saving the lives of the happy young couple. Anyway, it‚Äôs great and you should definitely watch it.

As a side note, I watched it on [Kanopy](https://sfpl.kanopy.com/frontpage), a streaming site I apparently have access to through the San Francisco Public Library. It is surprisingly nice! I mean, it doesn‚Äôt have the benefit of hundreds of highly-paid senior software engineers like Netflix, clearly; but it does what it does well enough to work. But more importantly, it has a really interesting and eclectic selection! There‚Äôs a few selections from the Criterion Collection (hence *The Seventh Seal*), a lot of documentaries, a lot of films I‚Äôve never heard of, and also a few recent big-budget films like *Midsommar*. Worth checking if you also have access!

Two documentaries this week. *Obit.*, on Kanopy, and *Helvetica*, which was [streaming free on the director‚Äôs site](https://www.ohyouprettythings.com/free) (*Objectified* is now streaming, and *Urbanized*, the third of the trilogy, follows next week). *Obit.* was somewhat disappointing for me; I had heard high praise of it (though I can‚Äôt remember exactly where, come to think of it‚Ä¶), but I found it slightly tedious. Unfortunately (especially for a documentary about, well, obituaries) it never really finds its narrative throughline, and while it‚Äôs interesting to hear about the process of writing obituaries from the obit writers themselves (though it doesn‚Äôt help that I found most of the obit writers mildly annoying, in that snooty-New-York-writer way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), it‚Äôs all-too-often derailed by asides that didn‚Äôt really speak to me, like when one of the writers starts waxing lyrical about David Foster Wallace. But also‚Ä¶ it was fine. I mean, like I said, it _is_ interesting to hear how obits are written‚Äîit‚Äôs not something you think about most days!‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt help but feel it just doesn‚Äôt hit the lofty ‚Äúoh, mortality‚Äù notes it aims for.

*Helvetica*, on the other hand, I thought was a nice little exercise in documentary storytelling. It carefully shepherds the viewer through the life and legacy of the ubiquitous font, and along the way explores the history of modern and postmodern typography, all without getting (too) lost in the weeds. What did I take away from it? Well, that Helvetica is‚Ä¶ fine. It‚Äôs fine! Erik Spiekermann is just mean. In any case, definitely recommended for any typography or design nerds in the audience.

Ah, yes, a Voxplainer about [Koreans in Japan](https://youtu.be/qBfyIQbxXPs). Except these are *North* Koreans. That have never resided in, nor are even citizens of, North Korea. Needless to say, this is a great watch about those [‚Äúimagined communities‚Äù](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399136.Imagined_Communities?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yBx9KU72uA&rank=1) Benedict Anderson kept going on about.

*Ugly Delicious* season 2 is out, which is sadly only 4 episodes. I feel like the Indian food/curry episode (the only I‚Äôve watched so far) doesn‚Äôt quite hit the highs of the first season, but I also don‚Äôt exactly mind spending 45 minutes watching David Chang try lots and lots of delicious-looking food.

Finally, two hilarious videos:

- From Krazam, who brought us [MAKRO Microsoft Excel Highlights](https://youtu.be/xubbVvKbUfY), an exploration of [microservices](https://youtu.be/y8OnoxKotPQ).
- From Brian David Gilbert and Polygon, an exploration of [Kirby](https://youtu.be/Udk8YHOy0EU). 

### What I‚Äôm Listening To

Nine Inch Nails released two new free albums, *Ghosts V: Together* and *Ghosts VI: Locusts*. They are‚Ä¶ very appropriate to the world right now! But, more to the point, *Ghosts I-IV* is one of my favorite albums ever; its eerie, terror-drenched ambience really speaks to me, which you could probably guess from how much I‚Äôve raved about The Caretaker‚Äôs *An empty bliss beyond this world* (go! listen! now!). And *Ghosts V* and *VI* is‚Ä¶ more of the same! Perfect listening to walk around the (sometimes but not always) deserted streets of San Francisco.

On a recommendation from [Flow State](https://flowstate.substack.com), I listened to a few albums from Idris Muhammad, an American jazz drummer who released a bunch of albums in the ‚Äò70s and early ‚Äò80s. Just from that description you can probably guess if he‚Äôll be for you. But! I‚Äôve become obsessed with the drum solo intro from the (otherwise silly) ‚ÄúDisco Man‚Äù, off his 1978 *You Ain‚Äôt No Friend of Mine*. Seriously! Just listen to [the first 15 seconds](https://youtu.be/0jdaTUfHLvA)! Have you ever heard something calling out so loud to be sampled? Yet according to Who Sampled, it‚Äôs never been sampled before ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also, George Harrison‚Äôs [‚ÄúArt of Dying‚Äù](https://youtu.be/EqLf2vgrymU) is a bop. That is all.

Finally, [here‚Äôs a really good mashup](https://youtu.be/JR3uz8rq4ng) of The Temptations‚Äô ‚ÄúGet Ready‚Äù and Black Sabbath‚Äôs ‚ÄúChildren of the Grave‚Äù. One of the comments says ‚ÄúI unironically want Soul Metal to become a thing,‚Äù which‚Ä¶ yes please.

### What I‚Äôm Playing

Obviously, a lot of online board games.

My coworkers and I tried [horsepaste](https://www.horsepaste.com), which is an online client for *Codenames*. *Codenames* is a beautiful little game by Vlaada Chvatil (who‚Äôs quite famous in the tabletop games space) and horsepaste is‚Ä¶ a not-entirely-beautiful client for it! It does work, mostly, though curiously there‚Äôs no UUIDs for games, just a user-supplied game name, which means if you pick a not-very-unique game name, like ‚Äúmobile,‚Äù you will almost definitely have randos in your game. Which, of course, horsepaste (being very barebones) will not let you know. Needless to say, this caused some confusion. A better option, to be quite honest, is [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io), which is basically Pictionary-but-online.

My coworkers and I also tried [Dominion Online](https://dominion.games), which is a very faithful recreation of *Dominion*‚Ä¶ online. If you know me well, you probably know that I think deck building, as invented/popularized by *Dominion*, is _the_ best tabletop game mechanic in history (and, possibly, the best mechanic in gaming history?). The idea of ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù your hand of cards to improve your deck in future rounds and, conversely, ending up saddled with junk cards when things go wrong is just genius and works fabulously as a base for more complicated mechanics (it‚Äôs almost as basic as ‚Äúroll a die to see what happens‚Äù). But *Dominion*‚Ä¶ well, a lot of later games take that deck building heritage and guide it in a more exciting direction; _Legendary Encounters: Alien_, my single favorite tabletop game of all time, brilliantly captures the tense horror-and-action atmosphere of the _Alien_ film franchise using little more than deck building and a line of hidden xenomorph cards coming to get you. *Dominion*, in its vanilla, base set form, is rather less exciting; it feels very mechanical and Eurogame-y. That‚Äôs not necessarily a problem‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty of games, like *Splendor*, that feel very mechanical and don‚Äôt have too much direct player interaction, yet still remain gripping‚Äîbut when divorced from its physical context‚Äîfrom the constant shuffling and reshuffling, from picking up and putting down cards‚Äîit ends up feeling a little bit boring. And, unfortunately, I have to say Dominion Online did end up feeling a little boring; I think my coworkers were unimpressed after the hype I had given it. My point, I think, is that board games are partly fun just through sheer _tactility_, and that taking that away really shines a light on the deficiencies of the design.

*[Monument Valley 2](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com/mv2)* is (was?) free due to the worldwide shutdown. It was charming‚ÄîI‚Äôve never played the (critically acclaimed) original, but I can see why it‚Äôs so famous, its mindbending Escheresque puzzle world works of art in themselves. But, I also have to say‚Ä¶ *Monument Valley 2* is very short! I finished it in something like an hour, which was slightly disappointing (although, as it was free, I‚Äôm not complaining). It did feel on the cusp of opening up into something more‚Äîon the cusp of saying something louder‚Äîand then quietly ends (not quite on an anticlimax, but more of an _unexpected_ climax). The feeling is somewhat akin to *Owlboy*, which similarly seemed to finally be opening up, only to‚Ä¶ end. Keeping with the theme of tactility, though, I wonder if it feels so nice just because you‚Äôre physically swiping and spinning the world around; it feels like a game that couldn‚Äôt really exist outside the context of that small, vibrating touchscreen we call a ‚Äúphone‚Äù these days.

I spent an hour or two in *Civilization VI*. My relationship with the *Civ* series is‚Ä¶ perhaps not _complicated_, per se, but definitely not as warm as some feel. It just never quite clicks with me; I feel like the feeling *Civ* wants to impart on me is not correctly imparted. It wants to express the broad sweep of history (problematic though its interpretation might be), but the fact that it‚Äôs essentially a board game, with very literal board game mechanics, means it doesn‚Äôt land with quite the punch of *Rise of Nations* or Paradox‚Äôs titles like *Crusader Kings II*. And, of course, I don‚Äôt feel like I have time to devote 5-10 hours to a game that feels mostly like waiting! But every so often I boot it up and give it another chance, devoting an hour or two of my life before getting bored and giving up on yet another civilization.

Friends and I also tried [Tabletopia‚Äôs online version of *Secret Hitler*](https://tabletopia.com/games/secret-hitler), which is an impressive recreation of the tabletop experience In The Browser‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, though it‚Äôs also more than a bit difficult to actually‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ play the game. On the other hand, Push the Button in *Jackbox Party Pack 6* takes largely the same concept but makes it much better for remote play‚Äîhighly recommended if you really need your remote social deduction game.

On the topic of all these online versions of games, is there an online version of *Love Letter* (my other favorite tabletop game)? It should be extremely easy to clone, but it seems like nobody‚Äôs done it yet. Anybody want to work on that? üòÉ
