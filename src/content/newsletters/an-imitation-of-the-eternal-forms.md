Boy, [what a year](https://is2020over.com), huh?

## What I‚Äôm Thinking About

Black lives matter.

I‚Äôve done the bare minimum (literally, the bare minimum) that I can and put a few dollars towards a couple worthy causes; I‚Äôll put up a list of all the ones I‚Äôve seen recommended at the end of this section.

But before I go on, I want to point your attention to a video essay, where (white) jazz bassist Adam Neely[^1] talks about [‚ÄùThe ****ed up legacy of the arrest of Miles Davis‚Äù](https://youtu.be/Sapc6BSxlRI)‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt realize Miles Davis ended up in an ‚Äúaltercation‚Äù with a cop shortly before the release of flawless masterpiece *Kind of Blue*. Neely makes the point that black lives matter not just because of course lives matter intrinsically, but also specifically because black culture has made up *such* a huge part of American culture.

* [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org); for those in the Bay Area, there‚Äôs also the [Silicon Valley DSA‚Äôs bail fund](https://siliconvalleydsa.org/donations/), and for other‚Äôs, here‚Äôs a [huge list](https://bailfunds.github.io)
* [National Police Accountability Project](https://www.nlg-npap.org/donate/)
* [NYC Books Through Bars](http://www.freebirdbooks.com/home/how-to-support-nyc-books-through-bars-during-the-pandemic)
* Paul Kafasis of One Foot Tsunami has [a few recommendations](https://onefoottsunami.com/2020/06/02/our-job-is-never-done/)
* And, of course, the [Black Lives Matter Support Bundle](https://itch.io/b/513/black-lives-matter-support-bundle) (which has my personal favorite game of all time, *The Norwood Suite*) and the *massive* [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) (which has indie darlings like *Night in the Wood* and *A Short Hike*), both on itch.io.

## What I‚Äôm Reading

I picked up a few more books from [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org), the indie-supporting Rebel Alliance to Amazon‚Äôs Empire. Of course, they do run afoul of logistics; $5 to ship three books, and they didn‚Äôt arrive for two full weeks üòî On the other hand, at least I can be glad it‚Äôs less likely any of the people packing and shipping it contracted coronavirus? In any case, I got Plato‚Äôs [*Timaeus*](https://bookshop.org/books/timaeus-and-critias/9780192807359), aka ‚Äúthe demiurge dialogue‚Äù, as well as Apuleius‚Äô [*The Golden Ass*](https://bookshop.org/books/the-golden-ass-9780199540556/9780199540556) and the [NASSCAL](https://www.nasscal.com) edition of the apocryphal [*Acts of Peter*](https://bookshop.org/books/the-acts-of-peter/9781598150223). I blew through *Timaeus* (and its companion *Critias*) this weekend, since it is rather short. It‚Äôs famous for being one of Plato‚Äôs later dialogues, where Socrates barely gets a word in edgewise, and contains his creation myth where the ‚Äúdemiurge‚Äù creates the world as an imitation of the eternal Forms that Plato was always going on about. Interestingly, it does have a lot of other content; it‚Äôs something of an ancient ‚Äútheory of everything‚Äù, and tries to explain everything from the construction of the cosmos to how the senses work (and all in about 100 pages!). It is, of course, incorrect in almost every detail, from our modern scientific perspective. But it is surprising that it predicts some aspects of modern physics in some ways; notably, Plato‚Äôs mouthpiece Timaeus argues that the four classic elements (earth, air, water, and fire[^2]) are actually made up of ‚Äúatoms‚Äù that are actually the Platonic solids (like cubes and dodecahedrons and so on), which are themselves made up of tiny triangles, which isn‚Äôt *too* far off from the colorful quarks of subatomic physics, not even to mention Tegmark‚Äôs [mathematical universe hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis). In any case, I‚Äôm not sure I can recommend reading it unless you‚Äôre very interested in the history of ideas, since it is, well, incorrect, and full of good old fashioned Ancient Values‚Ñ¢Ô∏è (Timaeus at one point claims that immoral men are reincarnated as women üòê). But if you are going to read it, the Oxford World Classics edition did seem like a reasonable translation; maybe the dialogue is just less heady than I expected, but it‚Äôs actually kind of fun to read? It also contains the *Critias*, the unfinished sequel to *Timaeus* that‚Äôs (probably) the ultimate source for the Atlantis myth.

Scott Alexander continues his wonderful series of book reviews with coverage of Julian Jaynes‚Äô [*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/), which infamously argued that ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Greeks weren‚Äôt ‚Äúconscious‚Äù and instead believed that their thoughts literally came from the gods (hence why the Homeric epics have an awful lot of the Greek pantheon messing around with people). That always struck me as a‚Ä¶ stretch (even without having tried to read the book), but Scott Alexander has convinced me to give it another thought. He reframes it as a story not about consciousness, but theory of mind; in particular, he points out that our modern theory of mind (that we are individuals thinking thoughts, and other people are individuals thinking their own thoughts) does not seem to be innate, and it‚Äôs entirely possible that the ancients had a theory of mind that instead emphasized divine inspiration. Admittedly, even this reframing runs afoul of ‚Äúokay, but what about China?‚Äù (did China invent modern theory of mind on its own?), but his review is still interesting throughout just for the concept of ‚Äútheory of mind as invention‚Äù, which seems like a fruitful avenue for further thought.

## What I‚Äôm Listening To

I discovered two podcasts this month.

The first is [*Wind of Change*](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/), in which a reporter investigates a story that the band the Scorpions‚Äô[^3] anthemic *Wind of Change* was actually ghostwritten by the CIA to encourage regime change in the Soviet Union. Now, that concept is already worth listening to; but the reporting does further explore a wide variety of other topics, like whether covert actions are compatible with democracy, why the topic is still so secret, and to what extent a musical anthem can actually exert soft power. Basically, come for the silly stories about German rockers belting out English power ballads while being watched by the KGB, stay for the deeper questions it raises (which is the point of all good nonfiction, no?).

I‚Äôm also listening through [*Literature and History*](https://literatureandhistory.com), a history of English literature from its deepest roots, by which the podcast means ancient Mesopotamia. Basically, each episode tells the story of some classic that influenced English literature (no matter how tenuously) and then explores the social and historical context of the work. I don‚Äôt really have a lot to add; it‚Äôs just a great podcast.

## What I‚Äôm Watching

Folding Ideas (one of my favorite video essayists on YouTube) has a humorous video called [Cooking Food On The Internet For Fun And Profit](https://youtu.be/4EXVrzOACv4), where he analyzes the nascent genre of ‚ÄúInternet cooking shows‚Äù and why they‚Äôre much more difficult to pull off than you might expect. It also mentions bannock, the Canadian version of frybread, as mentioned on [‚ÄúDancing Toward Wounded Knee: The Hope and Tragedy of the Ghost Dance Religion‚Äù](https://digpodcast.org/2019/10/13/ghost-dance-religion/) (linked last week).

I discovered a new video essayist, Solar Sands, this week as well. [‚ÄùWhen Art Restoration Goes South‚Äù](https://youtu.be/MilXnOVvpLo) analyzes the infamous ‚ÄúEcce Homo‚Äù repainting and argues that, ultimately, the botched refresh may have been more valuable than the original painting. [‚ÄùThe Secret Darker Art of Dr. Seuss‚Äù](https://youtu.be/3WSk86uIx2E) provides an overview of Dr Seuss‚Äô semi-secret ‚Äúmidnight paintings‚Äù, which are (perhaps obviously) much darker and more surreal than his children‚Äôs books. I really, really love some of the works talked about, like [‚ÄúCat From The Wrong Side of the Tracks‚Äù](https://www.drseussart.com/secretandarchive/cat-from-wrong-side-of-tracks), [‚ÄúThe Great Cat Continuum‚Äù](https://www.drseussart.com/secretandarchive/thegreatcatcontinuum), and [‚ÄúPink-Tufted Small Beast in a Night Landscape‚Äù](https://www.drseussart.com/secretandarchive/pink-tufted-small-beast-in-a-night-landscape).

Based on a Hacker News comment (when will I learn not to browse Hacker News comments?), I decided to look up some of the *Great Courses*, which, despite their apparent lack of budget and potato-quality graphics, are actually rather informative. Even better, they‚Äôre all available on Kanopy, for free, for anybody with a library card! Good stuff. I‚Äôve been watching [*Law School for Everyone*](https://sfpl.kanopy.com/video/law-school-everyone), which is a nice overview of the American judicial process and how lawyers work.

## What I‚Äôm Trying

Inspired by [this random blog post](https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/) I found on Hacker News, I decided to take the plunge and start a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). As far as I can tell, it‚Äôs still basically just a personal wiki ü§î In any case, as recommended in that blog post, I‚Äôm trying out [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com), which seems to finely accomplish at least the bare minimum of a.) adding notes and b.) linking them. I‚Äôve only added a couple notes but I already like the feeling of linking them together and adding to them over time; but, let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm still using it a month from now.

## What I‚Äôm Working On

I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôve continued to write 500ish words per day; I‚Äôm up to about 7000 words on *Bear* (which I‚Äôm still trying to think of a better name for) and added a thousand words to an older idea that never quite got finished. I‚Äôm still planning to devote some time to essays at some point‚Äînow that I‚Äôve gotten started, I can say I *highly* recommend a daily writing habit.

I‚Äôve also started kicking around ideas for a new game, probably digital, that would be something like a mix of *Civilization* and *Dominion*. Basically, you‚Äôd represent a state on a tile-based map (a la *Civilization*) but you would interact through the world via a deck building mechanic. I don‚Äôt have a whole lot, but in the spirit of [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), I‚Äôll link a doc once something non-trivial has been worked out for it.

Finally, I‚Äôm thinking of a new format for this newsletter. Like Robin Sloan and Craig Mod always say, it‚Äôs nice going into a project knowing that it will end. It‚Äôs almost the one-year anniversary of this newsletter, and I don‚Äôt think it ever quite became what I wanted it to be; it‚Äôs turned into more of a log of ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I read‚Äù, which certainly has some value, but I do think it could be something‚Ä¶ ~ more ~. I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôll change, but keep your eyes out for Adventures in Dilettantery, season 2, coming soon to a mailbox near you üôÇ
