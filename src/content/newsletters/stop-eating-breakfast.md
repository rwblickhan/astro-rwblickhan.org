Stop eating breakfast!

I hold to few [folk mental models](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/accessible-understandable-answers-in-a-broad-domain-of-interest/#folk-mental-models), but this is a hill I will, if not *die* on, then at least be mildly wounded on.

A couple years ago, I tried an experiment in intermittent fasting, where I only ate between the hours of 12pm and 8pm. I lost a *little* bit of weight, largely because I was no longer tempted by late-night snacks, but otherwise I felt basically the same as I always did. After a few months, I gave up time-tracking; I still avoid eating late at night, but otherwise I canâ€™t say my brave experiment in biohacking was particularly life-changing.

Except.

Fasting until noon implies giving up breakfast â€” a decision I have never regretted and will never revert.

I eat plenty of calories during lunch and dinner, and if I didnâ€™t have enough I would just eat slightly more in each. I donâ€™t have to rush to eat as soon as I get up â€” I can take the dog on a walk, calmly steep some tea, and enjoy my morning unencumbered.

Frankly, eating in the morning just made me feel sluggish all day. I do get noticeably hungrier come noon, but that just means I appreciate my lunch more. And if I sleep in, I donâ€™t get into the awkward position of eating breakfast at 10am and then eating lunch just a couple hours later.

And I can still eat breakfast foods! Bagel sandwiches are a lunchtime favorite in my household.

In case it isnâ€™t obvious, this newsletter isnâ€™t satire in the least. Avoiding breakfast is, perhaps, [my heresy](https://dynomight.substack.com/p/creative-nonfiction-training-exercises#my-heresies). Certainly, I have met few who agree, though luckily, I have one friend who is a lifelong non-breakfaster and kindly provided some of the arguments above. (Some of you can probably guess who this is.)

As always, if this newsletter bothered you, consider sending it to a friend so it will bother them too.

See you in a week or so,\

PS *Andor* is one of the best TV shows Iâ€™ve ever seen. I am just as surprised as you are that Iâ€™m praising a *Star Wars* spinoff show produced by Disney, but seriously, Iâ€™d rank it right around *The Last Airbender* and *Bojack Horseman* and just below *Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *Paranoia Agent*. It has magnificently clever worldbuilding, a fiercely political plot that puts *Game of Thrones* to shame, and Diego Luna being a cute little ragamuffin ðŸ˜­
