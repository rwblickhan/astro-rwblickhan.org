Despite being primarily an iOS developer, I use the command line quite a bit - I guess old habits from my time as an embedded software intern die hard.
That said, I like a number of modern command line tools, many written in Rust, which are typically blazing fast and have better command-line interfaces than traditional Unix tools.

## neovim

I have a noted love for vim, but when I'm not using an IDE with a vim mode, I'm actually typically using [neovim](https://neovim.io), alias `nvim`, which is a modern reimplementation of vim with much less technical debt, a scripting engine based on Lua instead of notoriously-idiosyncratic vimscript, and reasonable defaults like syntax highlighting enabled by default. It also has a full implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which enables it to have very rich, Visual Studio Code-esque plugins.

## fzf

![fzf's Ctrl-R behavior in action](../../assets/newsletters/fzf-ctrlr.png)

[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line fuzzy finder; given some input, `fzf` lets you search through the input with a fuzzy matching search term. One use I find for this is my custom `git` alias for a fancy branch switcher, `git b`, which lets me fuzzy-search for branch names when I want to switch branches.

It's also useful on its own! It can helpfully install a replacement for your terminal's Ctrl+R to fuzzy-search previous commands, as well as a Ctrl+T command to fuzzy-search files in the current directory (although, to be honest, I usually find this option less than effective).

## bat

![bat in action](../../assets/newsletters/bat.png)

[`bat`][1] is described as a "`cat(1)` clone with wings". `cat` is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often itâ€™s simply used to print a file to the command line. `bat` leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and `git` integration. I have `cat` aliased to `bat`.

## exa

![exa in action](../../assets/newsletters/exa.png)

[exa][2] is a modern replacement for `ls`. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than `ls`, I really only use it for one reason: the [pretty colours][3]! I have `ls` aliased to `exa`.

## rg

![rg in action](../../assets/newsletters/rg.png)

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), aka `rg`, is a grep tool; it allows you to efficiently search the full text of all files in a directory using regular expressions. Admittedly, it's often more convenient to use a real IDE's search function, but `rg` works everywhere and is _blazingly_ fast.

## fd

![fd in action](../../assets/newsletters/fd.png)

[`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a modern replacement for `find`. Unlike `rg`, which searches the full text of files, `fd` just searches filenames. This is useful in large codebases where you know roughly what a file is named but don't know what directory it lives in. `fd` has a more intuitive command-line interface than `find` and even ignores files in your `.gitignore` by default! I have `find` aliased to `fd`.

Notably, some of this behavior is also provided by `fzf`, but I usually find `fd` much more effective in actually finding what I want.

## delta

Don't you wish your command-line `git diff` was as pretty as Github? Well, now it can be! [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) makes `git diff` output much prettier, with word-level highlighting, line numbers, and an optional side-by-side mode.

## tldr

![tldr in action](../../assets/newsletters/tldr.png)

`tldr` is a utility that provides community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, meant to complement traditional [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), which are typically verbose. Instead, `tldr` provides a quick cheat-sheet for common use cases. I use the [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer) implementation of `tldr`.

## zoxide

zoxide is a replacement for `cd`, inspired by `z`, that lets you jump around quickly. At a basic level, it can completely emulate the behavior of typical `cd`. However, you can also give it a fuzzy search term, and it will use a "frecency" algorithm to determine which directory, anywhere on your system, to jump to. I have `cd` aliased to `z`, the binary for zoxide.

zoxide also has an interactive mode that uses `fzf` to fuzzy-find recent directory paths. I have that functionality aliased to `cdi`, though I haven't gotten in the habit of using it yet.

## httpie

[HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) is a recent discovery. I don't need to use `curl` very often to make HTTP requests, but when I do, it's always a bit painful to remember the syntax. HTTPie has a much more obvious command-line interface and also built-in support for making HTTPS requests.
