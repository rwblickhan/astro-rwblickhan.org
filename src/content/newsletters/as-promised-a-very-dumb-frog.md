This issue is an old-school linkblog. Not a whole lot of thoughts on my end, just a lot of web [bricolage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage). Share and Enjoy![^2]

## The Web Is A Great Platform, Actually

So I‚Äôve been enjoying my time as a full-stack engineer, even as Apple platforms once again draw my attention with [‚Äúspatial computing‚Äù](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/). That‚Äôs in no small part because I‚Äôve learned that the web is a great platform, actually![^3]

[Last month](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan/archive/did-you-know-stone-fruit-like-peaches-and-plums/) I talked about how cool WebGPU is, but that‚Äôs not all. Here‚Äôs an attempt to [build a signal analyzer on the web](https://cprimozic.net/blog/building-a-signal-analyzer-with-modern-web-tech/), with the takeaway that the web is very much ready to be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù platform now.

Also neat from a frontend perspective is the upcoming [scroll-driven animations](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/scroll-driven-animations/), which let you drive an animation from, well, how far a user has scrolled. That‚Äôs really nice! Sometimes I wish iOS had stuff like this, instead of forcing me to get a [border with corner radius](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/til/20230610-border-in-swiftui/). Similarly, I just learned about [Open UI](https://open-ui.org), a W3C community group trying to specify as many common components as possible. They even have a [neat chart](https://open-ui.org/research/component-matrix/) of every component in every web framework!

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt really have a point with this section, other than to point out that web technologies are really cool?

## Russell‚Äôs LLM Corner

Welcome back to the corner where we talk about LLMs (sorry). If you have a functioning scroll wheel, you can skip the next section, where we talk about a very dumb frog.

So my favorite thing I read about LLMs this month was [‚ÄùWhy Chatbots Are Not the Future‚Äù](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/boo-chatbots) by Amelia Wattenberger. Provocative title etc etc but it is a very interesting take from a Design Thinker‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that I wholly agree with! I‚Äôve linked before to Simon Willison‚Äôs take that LLMs will be more like [‚Äúcalculators for words‚Äù](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/) and this article goes along with it. I suspect most people actually _won't_ use LLMs via a chat interface for much longer, or at least not a ChatGPT-like interface; instead, we‚Äôll see them baked in as infrastructure for ‚Äúfuzzy problems‚Äù, like parsing text that is difficult to specify or providing tools for writers from a more traditional writing interface.

For instance, here‚Äôs [react-llm](https://github.com/r2d4/react-llm?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email), which provides React hooks for working with an LLM running natively in the browser via WebGPU (which I talked about last week). I could imagine building a mini version of [Sudowrite](https://www.sudowrite.com) in a weekend with this‚Ä¶

Or not! Here‚Äôs [‚ÄùAll the Hard Stuff Nobody Talks About when Building Products with LLMs‚Äù](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/hard-stuff-nobody-talks-about-llm) from Honeycomb, who built a Query Assistant‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for their product. tl;dr building products with LLMs is hard and requires a lot of tough product engineering. I guess product engineers don‚Äôt need to worry about their jobs after all? /s

Finally, here‚Äôs [‚ÄúNumbers Every LLM Developer Should Know‚Äù](https://github.com/ray-project/llm-numbers), modeled off the famous Jeff Dean paper ‚ÄúNumbers Every Software Engineer Should Know‚Äù. Even as a non-LLM developer, there‚Äôs some interesting rules of thumb in here, like how each word is about 1.3 tokens.

## The Very Dumb Pumpkin Toadlet

As promised, a very dumb frog:

![A pumpkin toadlet frog jumping and landing on its head](../../assets/newsletters/very_dumb_frog.gif)

It‚Äôs so small that the fluid in its ears doesn‚Äôt work right, so it has no sense of balance and just kind of falls on its head, which would seem like a problem vis a vis predation, but apparently it‚Äôs so poisonous nothing eats it.

I learned about this from [The Whippet](https://thewhippet.org/170-best-thing-know-about-bones/?ref=the-whippet-newsletter#the-pumpkin-toadlet-is-terrible-at-jumping), a newsletter you should absolutely subscribe to immediately if you would like to feel joy in your life.

## You Should Read _The Magic Fish_

You should read _The Magic Fish_ by Trung Le Nguyen! Drop everything and read it! It‚Äôs a very charming coming-of-age comic about a gay Vietnamese teenager trying to come out to his parents via the medium of fairy tales! But it‚Äôs not one of those sad Ocean Vuong stories! It‚Äôs slightly bittersweet but mostly optimistic! And you get to read a bunch of fairy tales drawn with a meticulous hand and an eye of telling anachronism! In summary: you should read it!

## And A Whole Bunch of Other Links

- A friend recently mentioned that they had tried huitlacoche, so I of course immediately looked up an [Eater article](https://www.eater.com/22688579/what-is-huitlacoche-corn-usa-mexican-food-bias) explaining what it was. tl;dr it‚Äôs a fungus that grows on corn that‚Äôs considered a delicacy in most of Mexico and a pest in most of the United States (something something cultural evolution). I would like to try it now.
- Don‚Äôt tell anybody that looks suspiciously legal, but here‚Äôs [Anna‚Äôs Archive](https://annas-archive.org), a search engine for ‚Äúshadow libraries‚Äù like Sci-Hub and Library Genesis. I‚Ä¶ may have set up an iOS Shortcut to search for things on it. And [here‚Äôs a surprisingly interesting article](https://annas-blog.org/how-to-run-a-shadow-library.html) on their software architecture!
- UX designer Erica Heinz introduces the [‚ÄúCraigslist test‚Äù](https://ericaheinz.com/notes/give-it-the-craigslist-test/#.ZFp8MKTMLVa). You can make a product beautiful, but what‚Äôs the point if it‚Äôs not useful? Folks use Craigslist, even though it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Craigslist. So perhaps it makes sense to make a barely-functional prototype to try to find product-market fit first.
- [Eyecandy](https://eycndy.co) is a ‚Äúvisual thesaurus‚Äù of filmmaking techniques. Just‚Ä¶ go stare at the gifs for a bit. It‚Äôs hypnotic.

## Today I Learned I Know Nothing

I‚Äôm still writing irregular technical [TIL posts](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/) inspired by [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net) ‚Äî I definitely recommend checking them out üòâ I also wrote up a [list of VS Code plugins](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/vscode-plugins/) that I‚Äôve been using. Also, in case you missed it (and want even more links), I have reading lists for some of the major theme areas I list on my site, which I update every so often:

- [Tools for Thought](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/tools-for-thought-reading-list/)
- [Consciousness, Identity, & Neurodiversity](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/consciousness-neurodiversity-reading-list/)
- [Culture & Technology](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/culture-reading-list/)

I‚Äôve also been working on a personal library [a la Borges](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-biblioteca-personal-edition?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=7000&post_id=126916949&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email), but that‚Äôs not ready for prime time yet.

Until next time!

[^2]: I‚Äôve finally gotten around to reading the radio scripts for the later series of _Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy_, which are a lot happier than the frankly bitter _Mostly Harmless_. They do, unfortunately, cut the long Douglas Adams rant about people with the name ‚ÄúRussell.‚Äù
