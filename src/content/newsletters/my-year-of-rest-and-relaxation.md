I did too much last year and I got bit! So this year I am going to learn to appreciate being alone again.

Coming out of the pandemic, I was suddenly an Extravert™️.[^1] I started attending every event that came my way and hosting a fair number as well.

Welp, I got burnt out, and wound up in some nasty interpersonal drama to boot. Plus, I set an informal goal of finishing a second draft of _A Curious Dream_ by mid-March, when I’ll be out a couple weeks for travel, and I suddenly realized I’d have to spend a lot more time writing in January and February to catch up.

So this year I decided I would be an Introvert™️, or at least be more intentional about how I was spending my time. Learn to say no to some things, you know?!

Two weeks in I am happy with how the experiment is going. It is kind of nice to have a yawning chasm of boredom commonly called a “free afternoon” and not feel like that is merely a rest break in between reps at the bodybuilding gym that is social life.[^2] It is kind of nice to feel like I can go meander on a bike ride for an hour or two and not “waste” time that I need to “power relax”. It is kind of nice to spend an evening at home reading instead of going out again.

In the words of _The Last Unicorn_, “that’s the way life was meant to be. You’re supposed to be too late for some things. Don’t worry about it.”

- If you haven’t heard enough from me, I wrote [an article](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/bookmarks/) about how I built [bookmarks.rwblickhan.org](https://bookmarks.rwblickhan.org).
- If you still haven’t heard enough from me, my pals Denalex and Jacqline invited me to chat about productivity on their new podcast [The Growth Gradient](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3W7scevGp0L4XV3x8ZKABM?si=FsSGuZ7QR-uKUzXolvhTAw). I came off sounding like a knock-off [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) but anyway…
- I finally read the classic psychology paper [“The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/), which introduced the idea that humans can keep about seven “items” in short-term memory at a time. However, the paper has much more of interest than that!
- I am trying to learn illustration (… very slowly …) and I like comics, so I was fascinated by [this reflection](https://joelmorris.substack.com/p/scratchy-ink-lines-on-cheap-newsprint) on a “corrected”, colorized version of the final _Calvin & Hobbes_ comic fascinating. Basically, they screwed it up, because the “rough”, muted comic was perfectly suited to its medium and its themes!
- For a friend’s birthday, I reached [_Tampopo_](https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/tampopo) again, which is becoming a yearly tradition I guess. This year I followed it up with [_The Making of Tampopo_](https://cors.archive.org/details/the-making-of-tampopo), which is halfway between a director’s commentary track and a documentary. However, it is _highly highly_ recommended for anybody interested in filmmaking or just “doing great work” in general; the crew on this film had such absurd attention to detail that it’s frankly a miracle the film was ever finished. Ironically, that pairs very well with _Tampopo_ itself, which is about an amateur going a little overboard in pursuit of mastery!

[^1]: Some may quibble with the spelling and say it is supposed to be “extrovert”. However I taught my laptop to prefer “extravert”. Also, now I’m not actually sure which one is widely accepted as the “correct” spelling. Spelling is strange.

[^2]: I’m not sure that metaphor made sense. Whatever.
