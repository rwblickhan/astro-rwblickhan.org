Hello! Iâ€™ve been pretty busy since the last issue, so this is going to be more of a life update newsletter. If thatâ€™s boring come back in two weeks please ðŸ™‚

I often find myself trying to remember some article I read months ago, so, on a lark, I built a [bookmarks site](https://bookmarks.rwblickhan.org) which lets me search the fulltext of my bookmarks (mostly pulled from [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app) but also from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault). I still need to polish it a bit â€” Iâ€™m just using the default [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) theme, without so much as a `<title>` tag! â€” but Iâ€™m pretty happy with how it turned out. Iâ€™ll probably write an in-depth article about it at some point; I used a fair amount of ChatGPT to speed myself up.

I also built a [little command line app called Linty](https://github.com/rwblickhan/linty) to check for banned regexes in a codebase (e.g. banning instances of TODO) in a pre-commit hook. This is vaguely based on a framework we use internally at Asana, which has more features but also does this. I donâ€™t expect to see much real-world usage (although Iâ€™d love it if you find a use for it!) â€” I mostly wanted to learn Rust, which is perfect for command-line apps, and build a [stupid tool](https://blog.stulta.dev/posts/stupid_tools/). Even better, I found out about [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/), a plugin that allows you to automate building and releasing a Rust binary. So you can actually install my tool on macOS pretty easily:

```bash
brew tap rwblickhan/linty
brew install linty
```

Again, Iâ€™ll probably write a more in-depth article about this at a later point.

Some friends and I (including Ker Lee, who you may remember as a [talented newsletterer](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/once-the-canadians-in-the-audience-recover-from-their-shock/#you-should-read-weekend-coffee-time)) threw together an open mic to celebrate the launch of a zine! Yes, we threw together a bunch of short stories and poems and printed it; thatâ€™s good enough to call it a zine, right?  Iâ€™m hoping to throw together a very-90s-aesthetic website to show it off. Maybe there will be another issue in the future? Anyway, the open mic was pretty successful.

And finally, I recently started a second draft of a novel I wrote earlier this year. Maybe this is the one ðŸ‘€ Wish me luck!
