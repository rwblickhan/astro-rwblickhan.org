Rough draft completed, with a total of 51,434 words. However, it is very, *very* rough — I will take November to basically completely rewrite it. And then, *then*, I will let people see it.

And then, if they like it, I guess querying begins 🙃

Very short issue this week — I just played tennis for the first time in a decade and then walked a third of the way across San Francisco, so needless to say I’m a bit tired 🙂

## Personal KRs

Something I’ve tried this year [^1] is to set personal goals for the year. “Isn’t that just New Years’ resolutions?” you might ask, which is fair. The difference here is that I’m setting explicit pass/fail goals with quantitative measurements to track them. For instance, I had a goal to “finish a rough draft of a novel of \>50,000 words”, which I can now go check off.

The real goal is to encourage new habits, since I’m a big believer in the power of habit — do something everyday for two weeks, and you’ll do it every day for the rest of your life 🙂 Another nice thing, though, is that I’ll be able to use it as feedback — clearly, since I finished one rough draft of a novel, that’s something I value, but I highly doubt I’ll finish working through [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) (I didn’t even start!), so maybe I don’t care about programming languages as much as I thought.

Anyway, this kind of goal-setting is common in corporate settings, but it seems surprisingly rare in personal settings — or maybe I just don’t pay enough attention 🤷‍♀️
