## General Site Updates

- I’ve added a [bookmarks page](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/bookmarks/) to collect a few of my favorite talks, articles, etc.
- I cleaned up the site taxonomy a bit more by adding a [miscellaneous category](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/) for stuff like the bookmarks or quotes pages. (Hey, did you know I collect some of [my favorite quotes](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/quotes/)?)

## Life Updates

- I’m on sabbatical in October! I’ll be spending that time writing another book (see below) and a trip to Hawaii.
- As you may know, I spent most of this year working on an epic fantasy novel called _A Prince of Foxes_. I got through a second draft of part 1 — let me know if you want to read it! — but it didn’t really feel like it _clicked_, so I’ve shelved it for now. I suspect I will revisit it at some point in the future — I really love these characters — but I need to take some time away and think about it a bit harder.
- On the other hand, watching _Nope_ finally inspired an ending for a horror story I’ve been kicking around since Halloween 2019, titled _Dreams of an Alien God_. I’m now about halfway through an exploratory first draft at 9k words — it’ll be a relatively short novella, I suspect — and I’m hoping to get the rest of it knocked out in the next two weeks or so in time for Halloween.
- I have a short story, titled _Three Lives, Three Lies_, from the beginning of this year that I’m hoping to finally edit into a publishable state. Reach out if you’re interested in beta reading!
