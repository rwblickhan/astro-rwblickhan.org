I have had a bad few weeks, I will not pretend otherwise.

 In lieu of original thoughts, here are some interesting links I‚Äôve found lately.

- Robin Sloan (you‚Äôre reading his newsletter, right?) has a new book coming out next year, and he built a whole darn [companion website](https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/). I wish more novels came with all kinds of bonus materials and deleted scenes and companion essays! Where‚Äôs my director‚Äôs cut of _Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_? (Interestingly I do think this is more common in the comics industry ‚Äî for instance, in preparation for the [upcoming TV show](https://youtu.be/dLvRvqByxUI?si=RceJfdDxs3bKd7EN), I just finished a reread of _Scott Pilgrim_ in its full-color, bonus-materials-included rerelease.)
	- Of particular interest is the essay ["The widening aperture‚Äù](https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/scale/), about stories that progressively grow in scope. [Sherry](https://sherryyuan.me) talks about this a lot.
- A series of articles about the nature of fame and skill in the TikTok era: an art critic puts up a [lightly-critical essay](https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-painter-tiktok-underground-2373157) about a TikTok-famous painter, TikTok-famous painter responds by [unleashing his followers](https://news.artnet.com/opinion/devon-rodriguez-parasocial-aesthetics-2380960).
	- I am also famously bad at taking criticism, but at least I‚Äôve never spent a day angrily encouraging bad-faith attacks against a critic who wrote a frankly very measured piece ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- I am trying very hard to memorize ["Beautiful Mind‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w1wwGcu0Dk), the latest banger from Tom Cardy and Brian David Gilbert. I think you should too.
	- As a bonus, consider also watching Tom Cardy‚Äôs ["Perception Check‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjlYFWLUDBQ).
- Dan Mall answers [common design questions](https://danmall.com/posts/answers-to-common-design-questions/), with short, punchy responses that exhibit exactly no nuance. It is partly a joke but partly not a joke. I wish more FAQs read like this.
- Here‚Äôs a rather new (to me) way of [thinking about LLM prompting](https://fchollet.substack.com/p/how-i-think-about-llm-prompt-engineering) ‚Äî consider it as a giant continuous space of semantic functions that take text to text, in which case prompting is querying in this space for a specific function.
- I recently read Peter Naur‚Äôs [‚ÄúProgramming as Theory Building‚Äù](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf) which was pretty mind-expanding (insert that gif of the science guy doing the whooshy science explosions. You know the one I mean). Basically, it‚Äôs arguing that programming just is the process of building a ‚Äútheory‚Äù of how the program should work and there‚Äôs basically no way to transfer that knowledge from one brain to another (e.g. in an artifact like the code itself) ‚Äî a new programmer has to just do the work to build a new theory. Anyway go read this paper it‚Äôs like 8 pages and very thought-provoking.

In other news, I ported [all my newsletters](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/) to my website. That also means you can search them now!
