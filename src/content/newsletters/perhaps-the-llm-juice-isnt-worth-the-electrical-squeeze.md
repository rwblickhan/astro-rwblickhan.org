This will be an unusually content-lite post. I’m moving, among other things, so it’s been a long week.

## LLM LLM LLM

*Update: I wrote two more newsletter exploring the ethics of LLMs in more detail: [But What Is It *Good* For?](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/but-what-is-it-good-for/) and [Let’s Think Step-by-Step](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/lets-think-step-by-step/)*

So this week noted cryptic skeptic Molly White  has a new essay out titled [“AI isn't useless. But is it worth it?”](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/). It’ s a great article and I highly recommend it. The crux of her argument is that AI *is* useful, but at such a high cost and primarily for such questionably-useful activities that perhaps the LLM juice isn’t worth the electrical squeeze.

I recently postulated to a friend that generative AI would have an economic impact on the order of, say, spreadsheets. Excel and its predecessors had, and continue to have, a massive impact on the industries it touch, but did it contribute whole percentage points to US GDP growth? Eeeeehhhhh probably not. So it stands to reason that most of these companies are going to vanish at some point.

Anyway, just to register a note of cynicism. LLMs are still *neat*, but outside very particular programming contexts, I haven’t really found a place for them in my workflow. I imagine some combination of Whisper + summarization could be useful if I worked with audio regularly? But working with them day-to-day at my day job, I do find myself a little skeptical that *any* LLM-powered product features are really that useful.

Anyway, I don’t really have a point; read that Molly White piece above for a very nuanced take.

## In Other News

- I wrote another article, titled [“What’s the Deal with the Prisoner’s Dilemma?”](https://rwblickhan.org/essays/whats-the-deal-with-the-prisoners-dilemma/). Hopefully it answers the question in the title!
- I recently cohosted an open mic to celebrate the second (!) issue of our zine. We made a [lil website](https://sf-frens.org) (a very ugly lil website...) to celebrate, which also has all the zine content if you want to make your own copy.
- This might sound absurd, but I’ve been manually updating the last-updated dates for all of these posts every time I changed one of them. That got annoying, so I finally wrote [a little pre-commit script](https://github.com/rwblickhan/astro-rwblickhan.org/blob/main/.husky/pre-commit) to take care of it for me.
