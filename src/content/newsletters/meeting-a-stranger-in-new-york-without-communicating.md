Here’s a Spy x Family themed KFC in Suzhou. The interior was entirely Spy x Family themed, too.

## Schelling Points as Human Capital

Recently I revisited one of my favourite articles ever, which I prefer to call [“Schelling Points as capital”](https://danco.substack.com/p/nfts-and-cbgbs-hows-that-for-a-clickbait). (The author is a VC thought leader type and the article is a few years old, so the actual title is “NFTs and CBGBs: how's that for a clickbait title”, and it ends up shilling NFTs at the end. Stop before you get to that point — I swear it’s a good article.) The idea is that Schelling points — that is, focal points in game theory, or the “natural” strategy that both players choose in the absence of communication — are a form of capital. The article gives the example of meeting a stranger in New York without communicating — you might choose Grand Central Station at noon — or funding a startup — the founder and the VC will almost certainly assume they are using [SAFE notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity). Both of these “focal points” provide value just by existing and being widely agreed upon!

This reread, I thought about how certain *people* could be considered Schelling points as well. I have a friend that shows up at practically every house party and, as a result, knows practically everyone. Her presence at parties can tip other folks into attending (or not), causing a chain reaction where an entire party can be populated by this one person. She is not unique, either — I know a handful of people who can be described the same way!

And here’s a Tim Horton’s, also in Suzhou. Apparently Timmies is popular in China now (???).

## Minimal Counterintuitiveness and Surrealism

I’ve recently been reading [Alex Mesoudi’s *Cultural Evolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633085-cultural-evolution) (fantastic) and one idea it pointed out was [“minimal counterintuitiveness”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_counterintuitiveness_effect?wprov=srpw1_0). Basically, humans cross-culturally tend to prefer stories that have *some* counterintuitive elements, but not that many — ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future show up, but otherwise it’s a normal Christmas for Scrooge. Mesoudi points to a study that quantified counterintuitive elements in fairy tales and found that minimally counterintuitive stories like *Cinderella* (counterintuitive: a fairy godmother, a pumpkin coach; intuitive: an evil stepmother, marrying a prince) have spread vastly further than more counterintuitive stories like [*The Donkey Cabbages*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Cabbages), a Grimms’ story I’ve never heard of before, but which certainly sounds... *incoherent*. I’d imagine Latin American magic realist works in the Márquez vein also count as minimally counterintuitive.

Perhaps this is why surrealism, and particularly *very* surreal works like, say, [*Meshes of the Afternoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshes_of_the_Afternoon), are not all that popular? Some surrealist works are so counterintuitive that they’re frankly just difficult to understand. So, as a writer that likes surrealism, perhaps a valuable lesson here is to back off somewhat — the most effective use of counterintuitive elements is to sprinkle them like finishing salt on top of a story.[^h2g2]

[^h2g2]: Some additional thoughts with respect to *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*: it has so many unintuitive elements, surely it fails the minimal counterintuitiveness test? I think *Hitchhiker’s Guide* is still a good example — it has many unintuitive sci-fi elements, many even stranger than the average sci-fi novel, but then it uses them for very conventional purposes, like making fun of bureaucracy! I wonder if that’s actually why *Hitchhiker’s* is fairly unique — in some sense it “reverses” the order of intuitiveness.
