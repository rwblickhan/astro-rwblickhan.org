I’m sorry to report that I’ve become a shoulder bag person.

I used to overstuff all of my pockets, sometimes wearing a windbreaker in unseasonable weather just for access to more pockets. Phone, wallet, keys, sunglasses, earphones... and then where does a water bottle go? If I want to bring a book or my Kobo, where do _those_ go?

I occasionally used tote bags for this purpose, but tote bags are a pain for daily use. I recently realized they’re supposed to be held in the hand, arms fully extended, instead of slinging them on your shoulder, where they tend to fall off.

Then I realized there’s an obvious solution: those Uniqlo shoulder bags that everyone seems to have. But in practice, I didn’t like the design, so instead I went with a [tomtoc Aviator-T33](https://www.tomtoc.com/products/aviator-t33-chest-bag-m), specifically the 2.5L version (which is apparently only sold on tomtoc’s website, not Amazon).

Highly recommended! It’s big enough to comfortably carry a 600ml water bottle and my other pocket gear, and if I stretch it slightly, it can even fit my [Kobo Libra 2](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2). But it doesn’t take up too much space on my back or add much weight to my shoulders, and it fits snugly on my back without jostling. I can’t believe I spent so long without taking up shoulder bags.

Speaking of tomtoc: I’ve been very happy with their high-quality-lowish-price bags. I’ve settled on three bags — the 2.5L shoulder bag for daily use, a [10L briefcase](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLD5G67Y?th=1) for carting laptops around, and a [24L backpack](https://www.tomtoc.com/products/navigator-t71-laptop-backpack-m?_pos=1&_psq=t71&_ss=e&_v=1.0) for travel. They’re all nicely thought-through (luggage straps! plenty of pockets!) and feel reasonably sturdy for the price. Though caveat I haven’t had any of their bags for much more than a year or two and I’m not sure how solid their warranty policy is.

My friend Kevin recently pointed out that he’s had the same Zojirushi water bottle for something like a decade. I was in the market for a new water bottle...

:::aside{.note}
My beloved [a6 memobottle](https://www.memobottle.us/products/a6-memobottle) receives far too many “is that a flask?” comments and only carries 376ml of water.
:::

So I ended up ordering Zojirushi’s [SM-VA60](https://www.zojirushi.com/app/product/smva), which holds 20oz (~600ml) of water, keeps drinks hot or cold for hours, has a handy lip for sipping, and locks so it doesn’t spill. Highly recommended!

With all that consumerism out of the way:

I recently finished the new R.F. Kuang novel _Katabasis_. I have... conflicted feelings. I love the concept in theory — grad school is so hellish that literally going to Hell is easier — but in practice found it a slog. It’s 550 pages! It didn’t need to be that long!

:::aside{.note}
It almost feels like two novels awkwardly stapled together. There’s a lot of _Poppy War_-style classic fantasy (bone monsters controlled by evil sorcerers) but there’s also a lot of Ishiguro-adjacent introspection about Being A Very Sad Grad Student. I probably would have liked _Katabasis_ more if the fantasy elements were cut and the focus was squarely on the mental torment of the main characters. But that probably wouldn’t have sold as well 🤷‍♀️
:::

Which led me to a more general thought. Is novel length an underrated aspect of quality? _The English Understood Wool_ works so well _because_ it’s a breezy hundred pages — the snarky narrator would get annoying otherwise. On the other hand, I just finished Stephen King’s _It_, and that certainly couldn’t be less than 800 pages — it needs the time to worldbuild Derry and introduce two different versions of all seven main characters.

But novels need to be “worth the squeeze”, so to speak. I need to get enough out of my time investment, and the longer I spend reading a novel, the more I feel I need to “get out of it”. So, for instance, I enjoyed Mariana Enriquez’ _Our Share of Night_ — but I probably would have appreciated it just as much if it was a few hundred pages shorter. Maybe that’s not fair! Maybe it needs the time to develop, just like _It_. But subjectively I “got more out” of _It_ than _Our Share of Night_, so I rank the former higher than the latter.

But then I wonder: are short novels always going to have an advantage? It’s just more likely that a shorter novel is going to be “worth it” for the shorter time investment. Or maybe there’s effects (like in _It_ or _Infinite Jest_ or what have you) that _depend_ on the additional length, and long and short novels are qualitatively and not merely quantitatively different. But then is it fair to say that _Katabasis_ would be better shorter, or would it simply be a completely different book?

In any case: on to Patricia Lockwood’s _No One Is Talking About This_, which I can already tell based on the first ten pages is going to be an all-time favorite 😃

Small-world fun fact of the week: Eric Schwitzgebel, my favorite living philosopher, was [advised](https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2025/10/why-philosophy.html?m=1) in graduate school by Alison Gopnik, one of my _other_ favorite thinkers, for whom the [“Gopnikist”](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/on-feral-library-card-catalogs-or) position on LLMs is named and who gave the [“Large Language Models as a Cultural Technology”](https://www.youtube.com/live/k7rPtFLH6yw?si=VkdwId1qL68hMkeH) talk.

Speaking of Schwitzgebel: I’ve been noodling with my concept of [farmers and foragers](https://rwblickhan.org/essays/farmers-foragers/) a bit more. A better framing I’ve come up with is _fundamentalists_ vs _skeptics_.

I might expand on this more in a real essay, but essentially:

- Fundamentalists have a single viewpoint and like to argue for it (so, farmers in the old framing).
- Skeptics have varied viewpoints and are more comfortable raising questions than answering them (so foragers).

These don’t map neatly on actual fundamentalism and skepticism. A lot of capital-S Skeptics are deeply fundamentalist about their way of thinking — “that UFO sighting can’t possibly have been aliens” — while many religious figures are profoundly skeptical — by this definition, the Talmud is one of the all-time-great skeptical works.

Anyway, Schwitzgebel fits into a long line of skeptical philosophers, from Zhuangzi to Montaigne, who I tend to prefer to more fundamentalist thinkers. I’ve likely recommended it before, but I love his [_Weirdness of the World_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/42710fab-1f4d-471d-8731-35462e45ed83), which explores various “weird” philosophical hypotheses, but more fundamentally argues for a stance of openness at the weirdness and wonder of the universe.
