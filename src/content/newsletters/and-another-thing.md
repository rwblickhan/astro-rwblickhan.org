Right after going to press, I saw [this video](https://youtu.be/Q734VN0N7hw) about Italians singing from the rooftop to survive quarantine and Chinese sending videos of support to Italy, which is achingly beautiful; despite it all, despite whatever rivalries and madness, humans are social creatures and stand together when necessary. It reminds me of a reference in *How to Do Nothing* (a reference to which book, I don't remember) that explained that, contrary to pop culture representations, after natural disasters people don't loot and take advantage of each other, but rather help each other out. And that brings to mind a poem I read, from the great (if sometimes inconsistent; not all poems can be winners) [Pome newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/pome):

## Small Kindnesses

> I’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk  
> down a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs  
> to let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you”  
> when someone sneezes, a leftover  
> from the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying.  
> And sometimes, when you spill lemons  
> from your grocery bag, someone else will help you  
> pick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other.  
> We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,  
> and to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile  
> at them and for them to smile back. For the waitress  
> to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder,  
> and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.  
> We have so little of each other, now. So far  
> from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.  
> What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these  
> fleeting temples we make together when we say, “Here,
> have my seat,” “Go ahead — you first,” “I like your hat.”

"Don't die," we are saying. Beautiful.
