Hello from the second week of a pretty awful chest cold.[^illness] I cannot particularly recommend getting sick. [^timing]

I‚Äôve been relying on Mucinex the last two days. This is a change, because: I couldn‚Äôt swallow pills growing up, which is apparently called [pill dysphagia](https://www.umc.edu/Healthcare/ENT/Patient-Handouts/Adult/Speech-Language-Pathology/Swallowing/Pill-Tips.html). The prospect of having to take a pill was a source of deep anxiety ‚Äî I would inevitably start to choke every time I felt the pill on my tongue.

I only successfully swallowed a pill two years ago![^swallowing] So here‚Äôs how I did it, which may be useful in the unlikely event anyone reading this is suffering from pill dysphagia.

- Place the pill on your tongue. Don‚Äôt panic.
- Fill your mouth with a swig of water. You should feel the pill float around your mouth.
- Immediately knock your head back and look towards the sky.
- You‚Äôll swallow without thinking as the water drains towards your throat. Importantly, the water will carry the pill with it, *but you won‚Äôt feel the pill in your throat*.
- Pull your head back. The pill is gone üòÑ

Once I had done this successfully a couple times, the anxiety went away and I haven‚Äôt had problems swallowing pills again.

Here‚Äôs a few links I‚Äôve been enjoying:

- [‚ÄúMy Heinous Gift Guide for Sworn Enemies‚Äù](https://holapapi.substack.com/p/my-heinous-gift-guide-for-sworn-enemies) is possibly the funniest thing I‚Äôve read this year?
- The [Half-Life 2 anniversary documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4) is worth every minute of its two-hour runtime if your childhood, like mine, was spent battling headcrabs and metrocops.
- ["But here's a thing that happened to me, and which surprised me at the time: most of the plot-lines of my life never resolved. At age 18 or 22 there were a few Big Stories in my life, they each felt momentous, and the thing I feared was that they might resolve ‚Äòagainst‚Äô me. But what actually happened is that they never resolved at all. Some of the most important people in my life just dissolved from it entirely ‚Äì whether gradually or all at once ‚Äì and mostly I've never heard from or about them ever again. The stories we were co-writing never reached their crescendo.‚Äù](https://www.atvbt.com/plots-resolve/)
- Here‚Äôs a [fun story](https://landley.net/history/mirror/institutional_memory.html) about a petroleum engineer smuggling his former employer‚Äôs documents *back into the company* because they had, institutionally, forgotten how their plant worked a couple decades later. (I have some thoughts about software archeology for next newsletter, so that may be why this resonated.)
- I met a neat fellow named Kasra a couple weeks ago and sure enough it turns out I follow [his newsletter](https://www.bitsofwonder.co). A few months ago, he wrote a great essay about why [philosophy is sometimes a deadend](https://www.bitsofwonder.co/p/harder-to-be-fooled-easier-to-fool), which resonated with my capital-P Pragmatic tendencies.
- Charles Fort is, *somehow*, one of the great thinkers of the 20th century, despite not really making a lot of sense. (He would have loved [my reference](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters/list-of-mysteries/) to the inexplicability of the Lead Masks Case.) So here‚Äôs a [long article in *Public Domain Review*](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/charles-fort-and-the-book-of-the-damned/) about the man and his very strange books.

[^illness]: Annoyingly, I was feeling much better at the start of this weekend, leading me to assume I had almost cleared the illness. Instead, I spectacularly lost my voice Saturday evening and by Monday had a nasty cough that kept me from sleeping. In fact the symptoms are so different I suspect I may have picked up a second illness en route to clearing the first. Alas.
[^timing]: To be clear, I‚Äôm *within* the second week, i.e. it has been 7 days since initial symptoms (assuming this is a single illness). Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not sitting on a nasty cough for three weeks without seeing a doctor!
[^swallowing]: I needed to take an ibuprofen tablet to combat the worst migraine I‚Äôve ever had, so it was born out of necessity.
