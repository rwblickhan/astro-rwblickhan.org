This is an evergreen list of philosophical positions and beliefs I generally hold.

## Consciousness

- Since I am a materialist, I accept the conclusion of ["If Materialism Is True, the United States Is Probably Conscious"](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/USAconscious.htm).
  - I believe there is likely a wide spectrum of consciousness, with humans merely sitting at a local optimum for consciousness. I accept that there is "something it is like" to be both a dog and the United States of America; that is, that both may have genuine [qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/).
- I am an [illusionist](https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Illusionism%20as%20a%20theory%20of%20consciousness_eprint.pdf) with respect to the hard problem of consciousness.
- I believe [integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory) is directionally correct as a mathematical framework for consciousness, although the specific details are probably wrong, due to critiques like [the unconscious expander](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1799).
- As a corollary to the previous three bullet points, I reject the existence of [p-zombies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/); that is, creatures identical to humans but lacking conscious experience.
  - In particular, by the three points above, consciousness just *is* an illusion produced as a side effect of sufficiently complex information-processing systems, in which case it would not be possible to have a creature identical to humans in information-processing capability but lacking qualia.
- As an additional corollary, I'm agnostic as to whether large language models (LLMs) are merely ["stochastic parrots"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) or may be conscious; indeed, in the theory above, the distinction is not particularly meaningful!

## Epistemology

- I am broadly a [pragmatist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/) in the James-and-Peirce tradition.
  - I am quite fond of the example of a man circling a tree trying to catch sight of a squirrel that is also circling the tree. Does the man go around the squirrel or not? James argued that it *doesn't matter*, because it depends on what you mean by "go around", and once you clarify that, there's no "practical" difference between the positions!

## Political

- I am generally a supporter of a broad public domain with relatively limited copyright.
  - As my go-to example: I believe Batman should already be in the public domain in the United States.
- We should not attempt to [colonize Mars](https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm). Send more drones instead.

## Programming

- I strongly prefer statically-typed languages and will almost always choose a statically-typed language over a dynamically-typed language.
  - I don't have a strong empirical reason for this preference; it just matches how my brain works.
- I believe software engineering really is a form of engineering, thanks to Hillel Wayne's ["Are We Really Engineers?" crossover project](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/are-we-really-engineers/).
