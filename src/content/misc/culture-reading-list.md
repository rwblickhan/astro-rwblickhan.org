Here's some works, primarily non-fiction, that I especially appreciate, related to the topics of cultural evolution, the cultural niche, cultural technologies, design, and the birth of our current global monoculture, modernity.

- *The Secret of Our Success: How Culture is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter*, Joseph Henrich
- *What Can A Body Do?: How We Meet The Built World*, Sara Hendren
- *Giving Up the Gun: Japan's Reversion to the Sword, 1543-1879*, Noel Perrin
- ["Large Language Models as a Cultural Technology"](https://www.youtube.com/live/k7rPtFLH6yw?feature=share), Alison Gopnik
- [Economics of Money & Banking MOOC](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5), Perry Merhling
