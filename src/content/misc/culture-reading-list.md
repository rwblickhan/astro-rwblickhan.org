Here's some works, primarily non-fiction, that I especially appreciate, related to the topics of cultural evolution, the cultural niche, technology from an anthropological perspective, design, and the birth of our current global monoculture, modernity.

- *The Secret of Our Success: How Culture is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter*, Joseph Henrich
- *What Can A Body Do?: How We Meet The Built World*, Sara Hendren
- *Giving Up the Gun: Japan's Reversion to the Sword, 1543-1879*, Noel Perrin
- [*A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry*](https://acoup.blog/), Bret Devereaux
- ["A Rant About 'Technology'](http://www.ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html), Ursula K. Le Guin
- ["The Failed Globalization of Psychedelic Drugs in the Early Modern World"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/failed-globalization-of-psychedelic-drugs-in-the-early-modern-world/6ADA9DE0F3FAC7E18591C7A96A53AA58), Benjamin Breen
- ["Large Language Models as a Cultural Technology"](https://www.youtube.com/live/k7rPtFLH6yw?feature=share), Alison Gopnik
- ["Is Cultural Change a Darwinian Process? No."](https://culture.ghost.io/is-cultural-change-a-darwinian-process-no/), W. David Marx
  - Not really a take I agree with, especially since he is explicitly using a "culture studies" definition of culture instead of an anthropological definition. Still, an interesting contrarian take to *The Secret of Our Success* and Mesoudi's *Cultural Evolution*.

- ["A Brief History of Making Out"](https://overcast.fm/+M6Vlh799E), *Decoder Ring*

- [*Money Stuff*](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff), Matt Levine
- [*Bits About Money*](https://bam.kalzumeus.com/), Patrick McKenzie
