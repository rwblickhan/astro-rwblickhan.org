## Non-Technical

- [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry][1] (Bret Deveraux): Roman / medieval historian, often focused on warfare via a pop culture lens; much more interesting than it sounds and one of my primary intellectal influences
- [The Whippet][2]: Fun facts and trivia with a strong voice
- [Robin Sloan][3]: Bay Area-based writer (*Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, *Sourdough*) whose newsletter are always full of insight; *Year of the Meteor* was the direct inspiration for my newsletter
- [Craig Mod][4]: Tokyo-based photographer known for long walks around Tokyo
- [Money Stuff][5]: Serious financial news delivered with dry humor; funnier than most standup comics
- [Bits About Money][6]: Newsletter about the intersection of finance and technology; slightly strange style but deeply informative
- [Waxy.org][7] (Andy Baio): Classic blog
- [The Untranslated][8]: Blog reviewing major literary works not yet available in English translation
- [Robin Rendle][9]: Writer and designer known for gorgeous photo essays like ["In Praise of Shadows"][10]
- [Maggie Appleton][11]: Programmer and independent researcher that brings an anthropological perspective to the discipline
- [thesephist][12] (Linus Lee): Independent researcher focusing on "tools for thought"
- [maya.land][13]: Classic personal website with a variety of "evergreen" and blog content.
- [Granola Shotgun][14]: Bay Area urbanist / landlord with an interesting perspective
- [Restricted Data][15] (Alex Wellerstein): Historian exploring the development of the nuclear bomb; known for creating NUKEMAP
- [Astral Codex Ten][16] (formerly Slate Star Codex): One of the intellectual hearts of the Rationalist movement; worth paying attention to if only for influence on Bay Area intellectual fashions
- [Marginal Revolution][17]: Arguably the most influential libertarian active today; deeply opiniated but can be worth reading, albeit with a truckload of salt

## Technical Writing

For each of these I dropped the description but included a link to a representative post for each. Many of these have a blog *and* newsletter with slightly different content.

- *Computer Stuff* (Hillel Wayne):
  - ["Mystery Knowledge"][18]
- Julia Evans
  - [“What happens when you press a key in your terminal?”][19]
- Aphyr:
  - ["Hexing the Technical Interview"][20]
- apenwarr:
  - ["Systems design explains the world: volume 1"][21]
- brandur:
  - ["Soft Deletion Probably Isn't Worth It"][22]
- Dan Luu:
  - ["95%-ile isn't that good"][23]
