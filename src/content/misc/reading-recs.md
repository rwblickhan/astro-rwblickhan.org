There used to be some reading recommendations here, but I've moved them to separate pages.
Consider looking at:

- [Consciousness, Identity, & Neurodiversity Reading List](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/consciousness-neurodiversity-reading-list/)
- [Culture & Technology Reading List](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/culture-reading-list/)
- [Tools for Thought Reading List](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/tools-for-thought-reading-list/)
- [Technical Reading List](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/technical-reading-list/)
