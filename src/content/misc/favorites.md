These are the ten storytellers or works that have probably had the most influence on me:

- Douglas Adams (_The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_)
- Bryan Lee O’Malley (_Scott Pilgrim_, _Seconds_)
- Helen deWitt (_The Last Samurai_, _The English Understand Wool_)
- Satoshi Kon (_Perfect Blue_, _Millennium Actress_, _Paranoia Agent_, _Tokyo Godfathers_, _Paprika_)
- Don Hertzfeldt (_It’s Such A Beautiful Day_, _World of Tomorrow_)
- Hideaki Anno's _Neon Genesis Evangelion_
- Wong Kar Wai's _In the Mood for Love_
- Phillip Pullman (_His Dark Materials_)
- Jorge Luis Borges (_Collected Fictions_)
- Warhammer 40,000 (yes, really)

As well as a few honorable mentions that didn't quite make the top ten:

- Gabrielle Zevin (_Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_)
- Mikhail Bulgakov (_The Master & Margarita_)
- Voltaire (_Candide_)
- Ursula K. Le Guin (_The Left Hand of Darkness_, _The Lathe of Heaven_, _A Wizard of Earthsea_)
- Mark Z. Danielewski (_House of Leaves_)
- Leonora Carrington (_The Hearing Trumpet_, _Complete Stories_)
- Marjane Satrapi (_Persepolis_)

There's also a few Western classics that I reference incessantly:

- Dante's _Divine Comedy_
- Milton's _Paradise Lost_
- Shakespeare's _The Tempest_
- Goethe's _Faust_
- Cervantes' _Don Quixote_
