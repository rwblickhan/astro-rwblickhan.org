Alternative title: cheaper but lovely gifts to give at a surprise white elephant party.

These are some relatively cheap, relatively small things that make life just a little bit better.
None of these are affiliate links or paid reviews - I just really like all these.

## Loop Earplugs

I'm religious about volume safety, perhaps because I have mild tinnitus.
So I like to have earplugs available wherever I go, especially for concerts or loud parties.

Luckily, [Loop Earplugs](https://us.loopearplugs.com) are perfect - I have a pair of the [Experience](https://us.loopearplugs.com/products/experience).
For $35 USD you get stylish-but-effective earplus that come in a keyring-sized carrying case.

Fun fact: paradoxically, these actually let me hear *better* during loud conversations; because of they way they're designed, they block out ambient noise more efficiently,
so even though your conversation partner is quieter, they're louder relative to the ambient noise.

## Peugeot Pepper Mill

Freshly-ground black pepper really does taste just a little bit better than store-bought pre-ground pepper.
A sprinkle of fresh pepper is an easy way to make a good meal great.

Unfortunately, the plastic pepper grinders sometimes found in the grocery store are... not great.
Much better to buy one from [Peugeot](https://us.peugeot-saveurs.com/en_us/pepper-mills), as recommended by Kenji in *The Food Lab*.
They're $60 USD or so, which is admittedly on the pricey end, but think of how fancy you'll feel when you grind a touch of pepper on your pasta.

## Saltcellar

Another way to feel like a fancier chef is to sprinkle salt with your hands instead of pouring it from a box.
The easiest way to do that is to get a saltcellar and fill it up with nice chunky [kosher salt](https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-do-i-need-to-use-kosher-salt).

I use [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07STN8DRL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), which was only about $10.
It's reasonably quality, with a magnetic latch for the lid, and it holds plenty of salt.

## Milk Frother

A milk frother can come in handy for a surprising number of drinks, from lattes to matcha to protein powder.
That also makes them a great gift for anybody that likes coffee or tea drinks - they'll certainly find a use for it eventually.

I've bought at least three of this $20 [Foodville milk frother](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V2ZGYJ1?ie=UTF8&th=1) as personal or white elephant gifts,
as well as the one I use myself.
