- [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com), Robert Nystrom
  - The best introductory work on programming language design and implementation, covering a basic treewalk interpreter and a more complicated, but realistic, bytecode interpreter. Notably, it covers language features like closures and object-oriented classes in depth, both of which are usually brushed aside. Also, it's extremely readable and has cute illustrations!
- [*Butterick's Practical Typography*](https://practicaltypography.com), Matthew Butterick
  - The best introductory text on typography and the basics of graphic design I've found. If you're time-strapped, you can check out its introductory chapters, ["Typography in ten minutes"](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) and ["Summary of key rules"](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html), for the highlights. I try to follow its principles for any site or app I build.
- [jvns.ca](https://jvns.ca) and [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com), Julia Evans
  - Julia has an iconic "I'm just as confused as you are" style of writing about complex technical topics like networking, operating systems, and version control. Her printable zines are a handy reference for all kinds of technical topics.
- [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com), Paul Hudson
  - The single best resource for iOS development (yes, even better than Apple's own docs). The free ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course in particular is a great place to start if you're completely new to iOS development.
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, Martin Kleppmann
- ["Email vs Capitalism, or, Why We Can't Have Nice Things"](https://youtu.be/mrGfahzt-4Q?si=sOjj_k4eGy3k2_sc), Dylan Beattie
  - Email development is notoriously complex and painful. This wide-ranging talk discusses why that is historically and some of the best practices for email development today.
