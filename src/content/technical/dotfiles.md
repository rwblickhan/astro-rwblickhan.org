## Table of Contents

Despite being primarily an iOS developer, I use the command line quite a bit - I guess old habits from my time as an embedded software intern die hard. That said, I like a number of modern command line tools, many written in Rust, which are typically blazing fast and have better command-line interfaces than traditional Unix tools.

## neovim

I have a noted love for vim, but when I'm not using an IDE with a vim mode, I'm actually typically using [neovim](https://neovim.io), alias `nvim`, which is a modern reimplementation of vim with much less technical debt, a scripting engine based on Lua instead of notoriously-idiosyncratic vimscript, and reasonable defaults like syntax highlighting enabled by default. It also has a full implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which enables it to have very rich, Visual Studio Code-esque plugins.

## git

### .gitconfig

I've set up a number of "cute" aliases in my `.gitconfig`:

```bash
[alias]
    b = "!f() { git checkout $(git for-each-ref --color=always --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(color:bold)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(color:blue)%(refname:short)%(color:reset) (%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset)) %(contents:subject)' | fzf --ansi --preview=\"echo {} | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs git log --color=always\" | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f 1);  }; f"
    c = "!f() { git diff $(git for-each-ref --color=always --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(color:bold)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(color:blue)%(refname:short)%(color:reset) (%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset)) %(contents:subject)' | fzf --ansi --preview=\"echo {} | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs git log --color=always\" | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f 1) HEAD;  }; f"
    cn = "!f() { git diff $(git for-each-ref --color=always --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(color:bold)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(color:blue)%(refname:short)%(color:reset) (%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset)) %(contents:subject)' | fzf --ansi --preview=\"echo {} | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs git log --color=always\" | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f 1) HEAD --name-only;  }; f"
    l="log --oneline --decorate"
    m = "!f() { git merge $(git for-each-ref --color=always --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format='%(color:bold)%(HEAD)%(color:reset) %(color:blue)%(refname:short)%(color:reset) (%(color:green)%(committerdate:relative)%(color:reset)) %(contents:subject)' | fzf --ansi --preview=\"echo {} | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs git log --color=always\" | cut -c 3- | cut -d ' ' -f 1);  }; f"
    oops = "commit -a --no-edit --amend"
```

These are a little hard to read, but `git b`, `git c`, and `git m` provide replacements for `git checkout`, `git diff`, and `git merge` that use `fzf` to fuzzy-find the target branch, which is useful if you have a lot of branches. Why don't the letters match the actual commands? They're my own mnemonics - **b**ranch, **c**hanges, and **m**erge. `git cn` is identical to `git c`, but lists only filenames. I stole these aliases from a coworker, though unfortunately I don't remember who exactly.

`git l` is an alias for the cleaner one-line `git log` output.

Finally, there's `git oops`. I'm not a stickler for commit history cleanliness - I typically combine related commits into a PR and squash-merge the result - but occasionally it is nice to squash a change into the last commit, usually when something got missed (hence "oops").

### delta

![git diff with delta in action](/technical/delta.png)

Don't you wish your command-line `git diff` was as pretty as GitHub? Well, now it can be! [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) makes `git diff` output much prettier, with word-level highlighting, line numbers, and an optional side-by-side mode. It can even be used as a replacement for `diff` in general!

### gh

[`gh`](https://cli.github.com) is the GitHub command-line interface. `gh` has access to most GitHub features, like issues and releases, but since I don't run a major open-source project community, I don't find those too useful. However, for most projects, I like to separate features into branches and make a PR, which is slightly more convenient with `gh pr`.

### tig

![tig in action](/technical/tig.png)

[`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) provides a nicer commit viewer for git. I use it for browsing `git log` and `git stash`, since it shows the log and commit next to each other.

## fzf

![An image of fzf in action](/technical/fzf-ctrlr.png)

[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line fuzzy finder; given some input, `fzf` lets you search through the input with a fuzzy matching search term. One use I find for this is my custom `git` alias for a fancy branch switcher, `git b`, which lets me fuzzy-search for branch names when I want to switch branches.

![An image of fzf in action via git b](/technical/fzf.png)

It's also useful on its own! It can helpfully install a replacement for your terminal's Ctrl+R to fuzzy-search previous commands, as well as a Ctrl+T command to fuzzy-search files in the current directory (although, to be honest, I usually find this option less than effective).

## bat

![An image of bat in action][image-1]

[`bat`][1] is described as a "`cat(1)` clone with wings". `cat` is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often itâ€™s simply used to print a file to the command line. `bat` leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and `git` integration. I have `cat` aliased to `bat`.

## exa

![An image of exa in action][image-2]

[exa][2] is a modern replacement for `ls`. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than `ls`, I really only use it for one reason: the [pretty colours][3]! I have `ls` aliased to `exa`.

## rg

![An image of rg in action][image-3]

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), aka `rg`, is a grep tool; it allows you to efficiently search the full text of all files in a directory using regular expressions. Admittedly, it's often more convenient to use a real IDE's search function, but `rg` works everywhere and is _blazingly_ fast.

## fd

![An image of fd in action][image-4]

[`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a modern replacement for `find`. Unlike `rg`, which searches the full text of files, `fd` just searches filenames. This is useful in large codebases where you know roughly what a file is named but don't know what directory it lives in. `fd` has a more intuitive command-line interface than `find` and even ignores files in your `.gitignore` by default! I have `find` aliased to `fd`.

Notably, some of this behavior is also provided by `fzf`, but I usually find `fd` much more effective in actually finding what I want.

## tldr

![An image of tldr in action](/technical/tldr.png)

`tldr` is a utility that provides community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, meant to complement traditional [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), which are typically verbose. Instead, `tldr` provides a quick cheat-sheet for common use cases. I use the [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer) implementation of `tldr`.

## zoxide

zoxide is a replacement for `cd` that lets you jump around quickly. At a basic level, it can completely emulate the behavior of typical `cd`. However, you can also give it a fuzzy search term, and it will use a "frecency" algorithm to determine which directory, anywhere on your system, to jump to. I have `cd` aliased to `z`, the binary for zoxide.

zoxide also has an interactive mode that uses `fzf` to fuzzy-find recent directory paths. I have that functionality aliased to `cdi`, though I haven't gotten in the habit of using it yet.

## httpie

[HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) is a recent discovery. I don't need to use `curl` very often to make HTTP requests, but when I do, it's always a bit painful to remember the syntax. HTTPie has a much more obvious command-line interface and also built-in support for making HTTPS requests.
