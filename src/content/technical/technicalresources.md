- [*Crafting Interpreters*](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com): A step-by-step guide to writing a fully-featured programming language, with complete, annotated source code. This is perhaps my favourite programming book of all time.
- [*Butterick's Practical Typography*](https://practicaltypography.com): Typographer-turned-lawyer-turned-programmer Matthew Butterick explains the basics of typography and text layout. I followed some of the advice while designing this very website, notably the admonition to limit how far columns of text can stretch.
- [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com): Julia Evans makes delightful zines that provide bite-size guides to topics like SQL queries or the command line. Her website, [jvns.ca](https://jvns.ca), is delightful as well.
- [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com): This site is the "user manual you didn't know you needed" for Swift. If you're looking to start iOS app development, I highly recommend both ["100 Days of Swift"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) and ["100 Days of SwiftUI"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).
