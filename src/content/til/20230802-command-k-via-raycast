I really like the [Command-K bar UI pattern](https://maggieappleton.com/command-bar) - many apps these days, including VS Code and Obsidian,
provide a single keyboard shortcut to open a typeahead exposing most commands you can perform and settings you can toggle.

Thanks to [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), you can get this behavior in pretty much any Mac app!
Raycast has a built-in plugin for "Search Menu Items", which exposes a typeahead for all the menu bar items exposed by any Mac app,
which also shows the keyboard shortcut for each option.
Luckily, most well-behaved Mac apps expose most of their functionality through the menu bar items, so this is pretty much as good as a "real" Command-K bar.
I've bound this to Cmd-Shift-P, which doesn't conflict with most apps' own keyboard shortcuts.
