Did you know you can add custom keyboard shortcuts for pretty much any app on macOS, not just VS Code or Obsidian or similar apps that let you customize internally?

I learned this recently reading the [iA Writer docs](https://ia.net/writer/support/basics/shortcuts?tab=mac#custom-keyboard-shortcuts-mac). If you go into System Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts... -> App Shortcuts[^change], you can set arbitrary keyboard shortcuts for any menu items in any app, even if they already have keyboard shortcuts set. That let me swap around Cmd-O and Cmd-Shift-O in iA Writer!
