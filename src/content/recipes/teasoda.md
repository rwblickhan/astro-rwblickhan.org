## Ingredients

- Loose-leaf tea — I usually use [Vahdam’s rose black tea](https://www.vahdam.com/products/blooming-rose-black-tea), but try experimenting here; *genmaicha*, matcha, or *jinxuan* oolong could all be good choices
- Powdered sugar
- Club soda — I usually use [Q Mixers](https://qmixers.com/our-mixers/club-soda/) or [Fever Tree](https://fever-tree.com/en_US/products/club-soda)

## Steps

- Cold brew 3-4 tablespoons of tea for a few days. I prefer to use the [Hario cold-brew bottle](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/small-things/#hario-cold-brew-tea-bottle), but you could use a mason jar instead.
- Make a 1:1 tea simple syrup by boiling 1 cup of the cold-brew tea with 1 cup of sugar. Keep the heat as low as you can to avoid crystallization while still dissolving all the sugar. Tea simple syrup should last in the fridge for a few weeks.
- Mix with soda water. Use just enough to cover the bottom of a tumbler; about a teaspoon should be enough.
