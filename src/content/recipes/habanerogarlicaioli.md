This is a little “fake” garlic aioli that just mixes some habanero pepper and garlic into mayo. That said, it’s pretty tasty, albeit may be a touch spicy for some palates.

## Ingredients

- 1 habanero pepper
- 1 clove garlic (unwrapped)
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- [optional] 1 tbsp olive oil (for instance, [Fat Gold](https://fat.gold))

## Steps

1. Remove the stem from the habanero pepper and unwrap the garlic.
2. Mash the habanero and garlic in a mortar and pestle.[^mortar]
3. Whisk the habanero and garlic with the mayonnaise until thoroughly mixed. If you want a bit more of an “aioli” flavor, mix the olive oil as well.

[^mortar]: You can also mince them with a chef’s knife, but you’ll get a better flavor if you use a mortar and pestle.
