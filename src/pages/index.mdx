## Hi, I'm Russell, a writer and programmer.

This site is my [digital garden](/misc/pattern-language/#digital-garden).
I post here maybe once a month, but pages are updated randomly.
I also write a [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/rwblickhan) called `rwblog`, which is cross-posted [to this site](/newsletters).

Here are some of my favorite things I've written here or on my newsletter:

- [The Bridge](/fiction/thebridge/): Borgesian short fiction about a creepy bridge.
- [Pattern Language](/misc/pattern-language/): A guide to some of the concepts I return to a lot. Useful pre-reading for everything else!
- [28 Pieces of Advice for 28](/newsletters/28-pieces-of-advice-for-28): In which I dole out advice that I have certainly not earned the right to give.
- [Calendrical and Cartographic Thinking](/newsletters/theres-probably-a-metaphor-for-business-leadership-or-scientific-research-in-here/#calendrical-and-cartographic-thinking): Comparing how we think when looking at calendars and maps.
- [Software Engineers and the Illusion of Explanatory Depth](/newsletters/unsusceptibility-to-the-illusion-is-inherent/#software-engineers-and-the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth): Are software engineers less vulnerable to the illusion of explanatory depth?
- [A REPL for Writing](/newsletters/react-and-try-something-different/#a-repl-for-writing): As a writer, should I deliberately practice time-to-feedback?
- [How many programmers does it take to fix a lightbulb? Fermi estimation in computer science interviews as discipline error](/newsletters/surprising-and-maybe-even-unfair/#how-many-programmers-does-it-take-to-fix-a-lightbulb-fermi-estimation-in-computer-science-interviews-as-discipline-error): Why I don't like Fermi estimation problems in software engineering interviews.
- [Cinema as the cathedral of modernity](/newsletters/you-might-not-think-you-need-a-milk-frother/#cinema-as-the-cathedral-of-modernity): Are films the modern equivalent of medieval cathedrals?
- [Modernism as Global Monoculture](/newsletters/a-form-of-transcendent-mysticism/#modernism-as-global-monoculture): Is there a single cultural "package" that we can define as modernity?
- [Safari is the Lightest Browser](/newsletters/once-the-canadians-in-the-audience-recover-from-their-shock/#safari-is-the-lightest-browser): Explaining why I like Safari (hint: it's the vibes).
- [Writing Compiler](/newsletters/in-which-i-wax-nostalgic-for-my-lost-youth/#writing-compiler): My preferred way of thinking about large language models (LLMs).
- [How to Read a Lot](/essays/reading-lots/): My tips on reading a lot.
- [Strange Things About Melbourne](/essays/strange-things-about-melbourne/): Interesting things I noticed while vacationing in Melbourne.
- [Communities of Practice](/newsletters/if-you-show-still-frames-in-sequence-fast-enough/#communities-of-practice): Thinking about why I find it hard to intentionally practice photography.
- [New Absurdism](/newsletters/eh-it-wasnt-worth-celebrating-anyway/#new-absurdism): In which I try to give a name to a new genre I see emerging.
- [Whatâ€™s the use of useless questions?](/newsletters/misplaced-institutional-incentives/#whats-the-use-of-useless-questions): What's the use of impossible-to-answer questions like "who wrote *The Odyssey*?"
- [My Favorite Bookstore Is A Library](/newsletters/i-should-probably-take-that-outline-more-seriously/#my-favorite-bookstore-is-a-library): Protip â€” many libraries are willing to buy books for you!
- [Small Things To Make Life Better](/misc/small-things/): aka "cheaper but lovely gifts to give at a surprise white elephant party."
- [In Which I Wax Nostalgic for My Lost Youth](/newsletters/in-which-i-wax-nostalgic-for-my-lost-youth/#in-which-i-wax-nostalgic-for-my-lost-youth): A navel-gazing quarter-life crisis post. It's funny how badly this has aged in barely a year, but it's interesting for historical purposes ðŸ™‚
