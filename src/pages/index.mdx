# R. W. Blickhan

I'm a writer and programmer.

At a high level, I'm interested in five intersecting topics:

<details>
    <summary>**Cultural evolution, technology, and the cultural niche**</summary>
    [*The Secret of Our Success*](https://worldcat.org/title/922703437) took my head off and screwed it on slightly differently.
    As a result, I've been deeply influenced by cultural and biological anthropology.
    When I say "technology", I *always* mean the broad anthropological definition, as memorably described in Ursula K. Le Guin's ["A Rant About 'Technology'"](http://www.ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html).

    - How does culture broadly impact our day-to-day life? How does it impact our tool use, our relationships, our thought?
    - How do cultures differ across space and time? How does culture change over time and why?
    - How can we use cultural evolution and socialization to our advantage?

    I keep a [reading list](/misc/culture-reading-list) of some of my favorite works related to culture.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Consciousness, identity, & neurodiversity**</summary>
    I am bipolar, specifically cyclothymic, and consider myself neurodivergent.
    This has inspired a lifelong interest in consciousness; my experience of neurodivergence has given me a slightly skew perspective on the topic.
    In particular, I am roughly an [illusionist about consciousness](https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Illusionism%20as%20a%20theory%20of%20consciousness_eprint.pdf).

    - What is consciousness? Are there other conscious creatures out there?
    - What is the basis for our personal identity? How does the perception of others impact our identity?
    - How does neurodivergence and mental illness affect my life and others' lives, in history and across cultures?

    I keep a [reading list](/misc/consciousness-neurodiversity-reading-list) of some of my favorite works related to consciousness and neurodiversity.

<details>
    <summary>**Tools for thought**</summary>
    I consider this site a [digital garden](https://ajy.co/digital-garden/) where I can [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).
    I am also a heavy user of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for notetaking and [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/) for spaced-repetition flashcards.
    I created the [Tag Search plugin](https://github.com/rwblickhan/obsidian-tag-search) for Obsidian and I publish [some of my Mochi cards](https://app.mochi.cards/decks/9be3f550-7ad9-49bb-91d3-524d9cb61704/hevDOgzY/Public).

    - How do we build more "bicycles for the mind"?
    - What are novel ways of interacting with our computers?
    - How do we make it easier to write clean, correct code?

    I keep a [reading list](/misc/tools-for-thought-reading-list) of my favorite writers working in this space.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Community**</summary>
    - How do we generate conviviality and "scenius"?
    - How do communities differ from markets?
    - How can we use Dunbar's number to our advantage?
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Storytelling**</summary>
    - Why do we tell stories?
    - How do good stories "work"?
    - How do we intentionally practice storytelling?
</details>

Broadly, I consider myself an Epicurean humanist.
