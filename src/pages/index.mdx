I'm a writer and programmer.

Professionally, I am a mobile engineer at [Asana](https://asana.com/) (see [my resume](/files/resume.pdf)). I have a bachelor's degree in computer science & mathematics from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), though generally speaking my interests lean towards the humanities (particularly literature, history, cultural anthropology, political science, and economics).

I live in San Francisco with [my fiancée Sherry](http://sherryyuan.me) and our small canine companion Rooibos.

## What I'm Working On

### *Dreams of an Alien God*

I’m writing a horror novel about a bipolar woman exploring a haunted hotel. The 20,000 word dummy draft is **done**! The first full draft will follow in the first quarter of 2023.

### *The Witch's Apprentice*

I'm writing a feel-good about a young witch who just can't do anything right. Think *Kiki's Delivery Service* with a touch of Leonora Carrington. The dummy draft should be done in the next few weeks.

### Rocky Climb Log

I'm building a SwiftUI bouldering log app called [Rocky](https://github.com/rwblickhan/rocky). Sign up for the [TestFlight beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/aSXcntYe)!
