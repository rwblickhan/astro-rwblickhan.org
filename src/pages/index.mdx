Hi, I'm Russell. I'm a writer and programmer.

This site is my [digital garden](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/pattern-language/#digital-garden), organized into:

- [**Fiction**](https://rwblickhan.org/fiction/): Various short stories I've written. These days I'm focused on writing novels, though.
- [**Essays**](https://rwblickhan.org/essays/): Non-fiction essays on various non-programming-related topics.
- [**Technical**](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/): Articles on various programming-related topics, including my TIL series.
- [**Misc**](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/): Miscellaneous pages, including my recommended reading lists and my favourite recipes.
- [**Newsletters**](https://rwblickhan.org/newsletters): An archive of all the newsletters I've sent!
- [**Logs**](https://rwblickhan.org/logs): I log everything I read, watch, and listen to.
- [**Gallery**](https://rwblickhan.org/gallery/): I sometimes take photos, so I put my favourites up here.

I also write a newsletter called `rwblog`, which is thematically similar but doesn't overlap in content.
