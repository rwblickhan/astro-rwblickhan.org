Hi, I'm Russell. I'm a writer and programmer.

This site is my [digital garden](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/pattern-language/#digital-garden).
I also write a newsletter called `rwblog`, which is thematically similar to this site but doesn't overlap in content.
You can sign up for that here:

import Email from '../components/Email.astro';

This site is organized into:

- [Fiction](https://rwblickhan.org/fiction/): Various short stories I've written over the years. These days I'm more focused on writing novels, though.
- [Essays](https://rwblickhan.org/essays/): Non-fiction essays on various non-programming-related topics.
- [Technical](https://rwblickhan.org/technical/): Articles on various programming-related topics, including my TIL series inspired by [Simon Willison's TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net).
- [Misc](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/): Non-essay, non-fiction pages, including my recommended reading lists and some of my favourite recipes.
- [Logs](https://rwblickhan.org/logs): I log everything I read, watch, and listen to.
- [Gallery](https://rwblickhan.org/gallery/): I sometimes take photos, so I put my favourites up here.

I broadly consider myself an Epicurean humanist.
I have a lot of interests, but lately I've been particulary interested in:

- [Cultural evolution](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/pattern-language/#cultural-evolution) and the [cultural niche](https://rwblickhan.org/misc/pattern-language/#cultural-niche)
- History and anthropology as a broad lens
- Social organization, kinship, and community-building
- Writing, literature, and storytelling
- Consciousness, cognition, and memory
- Neurodiversity and neurodivergence
- Tools for thought and "bicycles for the mind"
- Large language models (LLMs) and programming languages
