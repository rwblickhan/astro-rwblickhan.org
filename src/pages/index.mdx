# R. W. Blickhan

I'm a writer and programmer.

At a high level, I'm interested in five intersecting topics:

<details>
    <summary>**Cultural evolution and the cultural niche**</summary>
    *The Secrets of Our Success* took my head off and screwed it on slightly different.
    As a result, I've been deeply impacted by cultural and biological anthropology.
    - How does culture broadly impact our day-to-day life? How does it impact our tool use, our relationships, our thought?
    - How do cultures differ across space and time? How does culture change over time and why?
    - How can we use knowledge of cultural evolution and socialization to our advantage?
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Neurodiversity**</summary>
    I am bipolar and consider myself neurodivergent.
    - How does neurodivergence and mental illness affect my life and others' lives?
    - How have neurodiversity and neurodivergent individuals impacted history and culture?
    - How do we build tools and form practices to support neurodivergent individuals?
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Tools for thought**</summary>
    I keep a [reading list](/misc/tools-for-thought-reading-recs) of my favorite writers working in this space.
    - How do we build more "bicycles for the mind"?
    - What are novel ways of interacting with our computers?
    - How do we make it easier to write clean, correct code?
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Community**</summary>
    - How do we generate conviviality and "scenius"?
    - How do communities differ from markets?
    - How can we use Dunbar's number to our advantage?
</details>
<details>
    <summary>**Storytelling**</summary>
    - Why do we tell stories?
    - How do good stories "work"?
    - How do we intentionally practice storytelling?
</details>

Broadly, I consider myself an Epicurean humanist.
